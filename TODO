# TODO

## HIGH PRIORITY

- [ ] Store match history (the most precious thing we have) in cloud/safe storage, also so it can be shared with other 
- [ ] Uniform playerId/discordId

- [ ] Log all matches in separate, append-only file as backup
- [ ] Crash dump

## LOW PRIORITY

- [ ] Graphs Per player
  - [ ] Best teammates
  - [ ] Wins/Loses summary
  - [ ] Row colors per win/lose

- [ ] Interactive ELO calculation (progress, and live score changes)

- [ ] Settings UI - generated from rust struct (any in TS)

- [ ] Randomize Heroes by type

- [ ] Game graphics

- [ ] Tests and microbenchmarks for ELO calculation
